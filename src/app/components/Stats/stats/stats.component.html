       <h1>Simply The Best</h1>
       <h3>Get stats of your favourite player</h3>
       <p>“You don’t win or lose the games because of the 11 you select. You win or lose with that those 11 do on the
         field.” – Rahul Dravid</p>
       <p>“Some folks will say ‘Oh, Winning ain’t all!” But I know it is all. At the end of the day no one looks at the
         loser. So that is why we play to win.” – Vivian Richards</p>
       <p>"The joy of doing well as a batsman for your country is much more than that little joy of going for a party and
         enjoying music. It is a completely different high, and I get high by performances. That’s what I enjoy now.” –
         Virat Kohli</p>
       <p>“Nobody goes undefeated all the time. If you can pick up after a crushing defeat, and go on to win again, you
         are going to be a champion some day!” – Kumara Sangakkara</p>
